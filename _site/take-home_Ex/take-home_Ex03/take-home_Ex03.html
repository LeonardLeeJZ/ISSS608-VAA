<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anomalies">6 Anomalies</h2>
<p>With the data available, there are a few possible factors to leverage on to identify anomalies.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Beneficial Owners</strong></p>
<p>While companies having a single Beneficial Owner is not inherently anomalous, it suggests private ownership, which provides more control, privacy and fewer regulatory requirements. It is therefore worth looking into this in combination with the following factor.</p>
<p><strong>Number of Companies</strong></p>
<p>While owning shares in many companies is not in itself anomalous, the nature of private ownership suggests a certain degree of privacy and freedom from regulations. As such, it is worthwhile looking into caaes of Beneficial owners with more than or equal to 3 companies [<strong>Big Bens</strong>].</p>
<p><strong>Revenue</strong></p>
<p>Both companies with High Revenue reported and Unreported revenue (missing values) are of interest, since these are potential signs of anomalous activity.</p>
<p><strong>Products</strong></p>
<p>There are companies with “Unknown” products being transacted, which could either be a data collection error, or potentially anomalous.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will explore the following subsets of companies:</p>
<p><strong>Area of Interest 1 - Companies owned by single Beneficial Owners</strong></p>
<p><strong>Area of Interest 2 - High Revenue Companies with Big Bens</strong></p>
<p><strong>Area of Interest 3 - High Revenue Companies with Sole Big Ben</strong></p>
<p><strong>Area of Interest 4 - Companies with Large Number of Company Contacts but Undeclared Revenue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>General Findings</strong></p>
<p>With multiple Beneficial Owners typically signalling a company being in the public domain as a publicly listed company, sole ownership typically signals that a company is privately owned. Privately owned companies enjoy privileges that publicly listed companies do not: privacy, and less regulations.</p>
<p>As such, it is far more accessible for Beneficial Owners who are the sole owners of companies to utilise their various assets and connections to mask illegal activities whilst being poorly regulated by the industry officials. It is therefore worth monitoring and looking into these individuals.</p>

<p><strong>General Findings</strong></p>
<p>Having filtered the dataset to detect for the specific links between Beneficial Owners with links to &gt;= 3 companies, and Companies in the top revenue group, we can make the following observations:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mar de la Aventura presents itself as a potential publicly listed company that produces high revenue with multiple Big Bens.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, there are also cases where these Owners are the only one among their population to have stakes in Company within the top income revenue group. However, this does not shed much light on the specific group of companies/owners of interest, as this network graph could have excluded other owners who do not own multiple businesses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We therefore include another filter where we match the companies to a list of companies with only one Beneficial Owner.</p>

<p><strong>General Findings</strong></p>
<p>This specific subset of Companies x Beneficial Owners is worth looking into because both groups belong to an exclusive list of companies that are in the top revenue group, while having just one Beneficial Owner who owns multiple companies. In two particular instances, we see <strong>Tiffany Brown</strong> and <strong>John Williams</strong> being the sole owners of two top performing companies at the same time.</p>
<p>Though not particularly incriminating, it is worth looking into these individuals and their companies to monitor for any illicit activities that may be facilitating their high revenue across multiple companies.</p>

<p>While absent data for revenue is not an immediate justification to label these companies as participating in illegal activities, the noted lack of revenue being declared coupled with their suggested size (inconclusive without more information) warrants deeper investigation and monitoring.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">7 Conclusion</h2>
<p>Delving into the distribution and spread of factors such as revenue and ownership has provided insights that have been explored through basic graph and network graph visualisations. While certain anomalous areas were detected, there is insufficient data to conclusively identify any individual(s) or company participating in illegal activities.</p>
<p>Further work may include standardisation of product service categories/keywords so that the data can be cleanly segmented by product type. It would also be helpful if companies are labeled private/public to begin with, that we may compare within each category.</p>

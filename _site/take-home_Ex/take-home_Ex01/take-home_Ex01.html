<h1>Setting</h1>
<p>City of Engagement, with a total population of 50,000, is a small city located at Country of Nowhere. The city serves as a service centre of an agriculture region surrounding the city. The main agriculture of the region is fruit farms and vineyards. The local council of the city is in the process of preparing the Local Plan 2023. A sample survey of 1000 representative residents had been conducted to collect data related to their household demographic and spending patterns, among other things. The city aims to use the data to assist with their major community revitalization efforts, including how to allocate a very large city renewal grant they have recently received.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-task" class="level1">
<h1>The Task</h1>
<p>In this take-home exercise, you are required to apply the concepts and methods you had learned in Lesson 1-4 to reveal the demographic and financial characteristics of the city of Engagement byusing appropriate static and interactive statistical graphics methods. This exercise requires a user-friendly and interactive solution that helps city managers and planners to explore the complex data in an engaging way and reveal hidden patterns.</p>

<p>The qqplot compares the distribution of the data against the expected normal distribution. As the points deviate significantly from the line, the qqplot suggests that the data is not normally distributed.</p>
<p>The Shapiro-Wilk test is a widely used method to test for normality. As p &lt; 0.05, there is sufficient statistical power to reject the null hypothesis that the data is normally distributed.</p>

<p>The plot highlights the uncertainty associated with comparing joviality with the variable of having children, this is supported by the boxplot, which depicts relatively equal mean scores for joviality between participants with and without children. This indicates that there is no significant inclination observed between the two different states (having children or not).</p>

<p>Correlation Analysis tells us that of all the types of expenditure, Recreation has the largest correlation coeffiecient (-0.25), but is still considered a weak negative association.</p>
<p>The results suggest that while slight shifts in joviality might be observed with reductions in Food and Recreation spending, it may not be significant enough to justify the town’s spendings.</p>

<div class="bubblebox bubbleicon">
<ol type="1">
<li>Based on the analyses performed thus far, Income Level and Expense Proportion Category comparisons seem to draw the most difference in joviality scores.</li>
</ol>
<p>Specifically, proportion of spending between education levels seems to suggest that despite the relatively higher mean income associated with better education, those who spend less actually feel less happy than those who have a high expense proportion.</p>
<p>This suggests there is a population of Graduates and High School/College Graduants who may benefit from new sources of expenditure. Despite weak positive correlation between Shelter spending and joviality, it is suggested that the town explore developing a small number of high quality residences for this group of people.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>The town can also look into affordability schemes for middle to low income earners, so as to reduce the number of people within the Low-Middle and Middle-High Expense Proportion Categories.</li>

<li><p>Sample selection method does not assure us of accurate representation, as there is no information on demographic distribution and survey methods.</p></li>
<li><p>Correlation does not equate causation. While there are indicative signs of some association between joviality scores and select variables, the data collected may not be holistic enough to completely capture the nuance of all factors involved. This can be mitigated through conducting several rounds of survey and to ensure the population is well-accounted for.</p></li>
